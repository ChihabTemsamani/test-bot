# DiscordBot
A Discord bot made with JDA and Spring Boot. This project is also running on Heroku.

## Commands
All commands can be found in [src/main/java/com/ricky/spring/MessageResponder.java](https://github.com/RickyDiculous/DiscordBot/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ricky/spring/MessageResponder.java).
Here are a few of my favorites:
